Purposely built to host multiple campus programs, this 400-sqm facility also provides a new venue for university-wide gatherings. This center offers an indoor facility's convenience, wherein other stakeholders' need for space for celebrations and occasions is accommodated. This facility is a new step in bringing the academic, cultural, athletic departments, and the community closer together.
